# Project roadmap
-----------------
## 1
  - getting single pin readings to work at 20MHz
## 2
  - optimizing for highest possible frequencies
## 3
  - Implement multithreading and multipin support
  - Implement dynamic max_freq rules based on amount of pins
## 4
  - Implement ADC and DAC support for osciloscope and function generator capabilities
    - 10-bit ADC. bit's should be apppended to matrix as normal. Conversion to analog values should only happen in post process.

## Final goal:
The goal of this project will be (long term) to make a framework the community can build upon to allow for osciloscope, function generators, and other essential electronics tools to be easily accessible by electronics enthusiasts the world over, without breaking the bank. A raspberry pi 4, and a couple of ADCs and DACs should only set you back a < 100 dollars (and even less if you already have an RPI or 2 (which many electronics enthusiasts already have)) compared to several hundred or several thousands for a "propper" one
