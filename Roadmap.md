# Project roadmap
-----------------
## 1
  - getting single pin readings to work at 20MHz
## 2
  - optimizing for highest possible frequencies
## 3
  - Implement multithreading and multipin support
  - Implement dynamic max_freq rules based on amount of pins
## 4
  - Implement ADC and DAC support for osciloscope and function generator capabilities
    - 10-bit ADC. bit's should be apppended to matrix as normal. Conversion to analog values should only happen in post process.

## Final goal:
The goal of this project will be (long term) to make a framework the community can build upon to allow for osciloscope, function generators, and other essential electronics tools to get easily accessible without breaking the bank
